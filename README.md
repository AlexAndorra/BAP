# Bayesian Analysis with Python (Second edition)

This is the code repository for [Bayesian Analysis with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/bayesian-analysis-python-second-edition), published by Packt. It contains all the code necessary to work through the book from start to finish. You can find the (old) code from the first edition in the folder `First_edition`

## Installation

The code in the book was written using Python version >= 3.6.

Maybe the easiest way to install Python and Python libraries is using Anaconda, a scientific computing distribution. You can read more about Anaconda and 
download it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Once Anaconda is installed in your system, you can install new Python packages with the command: 

```
conda install NamePackage
```

We will use the following python packages:

* Ipython 7.0
* Jupyter 1.0 (or Jupyter-lab 0.35)
* NumPy 1.14.5
* SciPy 0.18.1
* Pandas  0.23.4
* Matplotlib 3.0
* Seaborn 0.9.0
* ArviZ 0.3
* PyMC3 3.6
